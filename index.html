            <ol>
            <li>Squairr Product. Civily provides a software-as-a-service 
                permissioning product (the “Squairr Product”) directly to 
                our public sector clients (“Clients”) to enable them to serve
                 and perform their own governmental and business functions.
                  As such, most of the Personal Information we collect and 
                  store is in connection with the software and services we 
                  provide to our Clients pursuant to our contractual arrangements 
                  with them. In these cases, Civily is acting as a “data custodian”.
            </li>
            <li>
                Service. The “Service” we provide to you, the Customer 
                Property User includes: (1) Civily’s website (located at
                 https://www.civily.africa) and Squairr app (located at https://squairr.com)
                  (together, the “Site”) and iOS and Android apps (the “Apps”) as may
                   be updated, relocated, or otherwise modified from time to time; 
                   (2) all content on the Site and Apps and all intellectual property
                    rights arising out of or related to the foregoing.
            </li>
            <li>
                License. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, 
                Civily hereby grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, 
                non-transferable license to access the Site, to download 
                a copy of the Apps, in each case, solely for your 
                personal use or for internal business purposes.

        <li style="font-size: 20px;">Civily’s Role and Your Risks.</li>
        
        <p>
            Civily is a technology company, not a money transmission business.
             Because Civily is a technology company that facilitates
              access to services that are platform based, financial-
              based and/or involve acquiring, holding, or using money,
               to use the Service you acknowledge that participating 
               in or using the Service requires you to take on certain risks.

            </p>
        

        
        <li style="font-size: 20px;">No Fiduciary Relationship.</li>
        <p>
                Except to the extent set forth in a separate agreement
                 between you and us, there is no fiduciary relationship
                  between you and us. These Terms do not create any 
                  relationship of principal and agent, partnership, 
                  joint venture, or employer and employee, between you
                   and us. You may not enter into any contract on our 
                   behalf or bind us in any way.

        </p>

                  accurate, Civily may terminate these Terms and your

                     continue as long as you continue until terminated.</li>
                <li>Termination. If you breach (or if Civily suspects you have breached) 
                    these Terms, Civily may, in its sole discretion, terminate these 
                    Terms and your User account and/or limit, suspend, or terminate 
                    your access to the Apps or Service, with or without notice. You 
                    may terminate these Terms by contacting us at <a href="hello@civily.africa">hello@civily.africa</a></li>
                <li>Effect of Termination. Upon termination of these Terms, 
                    you remain obligated to pay any outstanding fees relating to 
                    your use of the Service that were incurred prior to termination.

                    of these Terms is without prejudice to any other remedies it may have 
                    at law or in equity, and does not relieve either party of liability for 
                    breaches occurring prior to the effective date of termination. Neither 
                    party will be liable to the other for damages arising solely

                    or court order made in connection with the Claim. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, 
                    you may not enter into any settlement that involves an admission of guilt or liability 
                    of a Civily Party without Civily’s prior written consent. Civily may participate in 
                    the defense of a Claim at its own expense and with counsel of its own choosing.</li>
                <li>Indemnification. You will indemnify the Civily Parties from and pay: 
                    (1) all damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees finally awarded against a Civily Party in 
                    any Claim; (2) all out-of-pocket costs (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably 
                    incurred by a Civily Party in connection with the defense of a Claim; and (3) 
                    all amounts that you agree to pay to any third party to settle any Claim.</li>

                    NEITHER CIVILY NOR ANY CIVILY PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, 
                    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE 
                    TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, 
                    OR LOSS OF DATA, EVEN IF CIVILY IS APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES 
                    OCCURRING. CIVILY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY, OR LOSSES

            <ol>
                <li> Generally. If you are not a resident of the Federal Republic, 
                    this Section 16 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will only apply to you 
                    to the extent applicable law in your country of residence permits. 
                    In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Civily in the 
                    most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Civily agree that any 
                    dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be 
                    resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead 
                    of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. 
                    Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. 
                    This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of 
                    or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether 
                    based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other 
                    legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the 
                    expiration or termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY 
                    ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CIVILY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A 
                    TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER 
                    UNDERSTAND THAT THIS SECTION 16 WILL APPLY TO YOU AND CIVILY UNLESS YOU 
                    CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO SECTION 16.J (OPT OUT). Whether to agree to 
                    arbitration is an important decision. It is your decision to make, and you 
                    should not rely solely on the information provided in these Terms, as they 
                    are not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of 
                    arbitration. You should take further steps to conduct research and to consult 
                    with others, including an attorney, regarding the consequences of your decision, 
                    just as you would when making any other important business or life decision.</li>
                <li>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Civily will be governed by the Federal 
                    Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the 
                    Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitrator has exclusive 
                    authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or 
                    enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</li>
                <li>Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice 
                    of the dispute to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period 
                    (“Notice”). Civily’s email address for Notice is 
                    <a href="https://squairr.com/terms-and-conditions#">hello@civily.africa</a>. The Notice must: 
                    (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific 
                    relief sought; and (3) if you are sending the Notice to Civily, include your name and 
                    address (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, 
                    but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 45 days after the Notice is 
                    received, you or Civily may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, 
                    the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Civily must not be disclosed to the 
                    arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the 
                    dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Civily will pay you the 
                    highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (b) the last 
                    written settlement amount offered by Civily in settlement of the dispute prior to the 
                    arbitrator’s award; or (c) $1,000.</li>
                <li>Confidentiality. The parties agree to keep confidential the existence 
                    of the arbitration, the arbitral proceedings, the submissions made by the parties, 
                    and the decisions made by the arbitrator, including its awards, except as required by 
                    applicable law and to the extent not already in the public domain.</li>
                <li>No Class Actions. YOU AND CIVILY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS 
                    AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A 
                    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
                    Unless both you and Civily agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate 
                    more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a 
                    representative or class proceeding.</li>
                <li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Civily makes any future 
                    change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Civily’s 
                    address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice 
                    within 30 days of the change to Civily’s address for Notice, in which case 
                    this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes 
                    you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Civily. 
                    If you do not send such written notice, your continued use of the Service 
                    following any such change means that you have consented to such change.</li>
                <li>Enforceability. If Section 16.E (No Class Actions) is found 
                    to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 16 (Arbitration) 
                    is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will 
                    be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in 
                    Section 19.B (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to 
                    these Terms or your use of the Service.</li>
                <li>Opt Out. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. 
                    If you do not want to be subject to this Section 16 (Arbitration), you may opt 
                    out by notifying Civily in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days 
                    after the effective date of these Terms, an email to hello@civily.africa, 
                    stating clearly your full name, address, and intent to opt out of this 
                    Section 16. Should you choose not to opt out within the 30-day period, 
                    you and Civily will be bound by the terms of this Section 16. You have the 
                    right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning your right to opt 
                    out of this Section 16, and you understand that you will not be subject 
                    to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <p><li style="font-size: 20px;">Cooperation with Authorities.</li></p>
            <p>
                Civily may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the 
                    investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. 
                    Except as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy, Civily 
                    may disclose any information as Civily deems necessary to satisfy 
                    any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental 
                    request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information 
                    or materials, in whole or in part, in Civily’s sole discretion.</p>
            
                <p><li style="font-size: 20px;"> Limitation of Liability</li></p>
                 <ol>
                        <p>Nothing in these Terms limit or prohibit you from filing a charge or 
                            complaint with, or otherwise communicating or cooperating with or 
                            participating in, any investigation or proceeding that may be 
                            conducted by any international, federal, state, provincial, or 
                            local government agency or commission (“Protected Activity”). 
                            In connection with such Protected Activity, you are permitted to 
                            disclose documents or other information as permitted by law, and 
                            without giving notice to, or receiving authorization from, Civily. 
                            In making any such disclosures or communications, you agree to take 
                            all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure 
                            of any information that may constitute Civily confidential information to 
                            any parties other than the applicable government agencies.
                        </p>
                        <li>Compliance with Applicable Law. You will comply with all applicable 
                            international, federal, state, provincial, and local laws, regulations, 
                            binding regulatory guidance, directives, and governmental requirements 
                            in connection with exercising your rights or performing your obligations 
                            under these Terms. YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY 
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY AND ALL LAWS OR REGULATIONS. 
                            CIVILY ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAWS OR 
                            REGULATIONS REGARDING CUSTOMER’S PROPERTY OR SERVICES OR YOUR USE 
                            OF THE GOVLY OR SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH CUSTOMER PROPERTY OR SERVICES, 
                            OR ANY RELATED ACTIVITIES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CIVILY IS NOT 
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND WILL NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMER WITH ANY ADVICE, COUNSEL, OR 
                            RECOMMENDATION PERTAINING TO LEGAL COMPLIANCE, OR YOUR USE OF GOVLY IN

            <ol>
                <li> GSubcontractors. Civily may use subcontractors or other third parties to perform its 
                    obligations under these Terms, but Civily will remain responsible for all such obligations.</li>
                <li>Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the Nigerian law without 
                    reference to its conflict of laws principles. The parties submit to the 
                    jurisdiction of those courts. In any proceeding to enforce rights under 
                    these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.</li>
                <li>Injunctive Relief. If you breach Sections 4 (Accounts; Registration; 
                    Restrictions), 8 (Ownership), or 9 (Confidentiality), Civily may suffer irreparable 
                    harm, and monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Civily. Accordingly, 
                    Civily may, in addition to any other remedies available, seek injunctive or other 
                    equitable relief in response to any such breach.</li>
                <li>Further Assurances. You agree to execute and deliver any documents or instruments, 
                    and take any further actions that are reasonably required, to provide the other 
                    party the full benefits and rights described in these Terms.</li>
                <li>Assignment. You may not assign these Terms or delegate your performance 
                    without Civily’s prior written consent, and any attempt to do so is void. 
                    Civily may assign or transfer these Terms without your consent. 
                    These Terms are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ permitted successors and assigns.</li>
                <li>Severability. If any provision of these Terms or portion of a provision is 
                    invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the rest of these Terms will remain in effect.</li>
                <li>No Waiver. Neither party will be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising 
                    (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under these Terms.</li>
                <li>Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and 
                    supersede any other agreement of the parties relating to their subject matter. 
                    No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties 
                    will be used to modify, interpret, or supplement these Terms.</li>
                <li>Nature of Rights. The licenses granted under these Terms are rights in 
                    “intellectual property” within the scope of Section 101 (or its successors) of 
                    the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Code”). Each party as licensee will have 
                    and may fully exercise all rights available to a licensee under the Code, including 
                    under Section 365(n) or its successors.</li>
                <li>No Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, 
                    except as described in Section 21 (Notice Regarding Apple).</li>
